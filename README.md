Final group project for the COP3530 - Data Structures and Algorithms
Group members: Shravya Iruvanti, Mikayla Hill, Samuel Liechty

Project description: The purpose of this project is to compare the speeds of
two data structures - an AVL Tree and a Hash Map.
Of course, these two data structures serve very different purposes, but the point
of this project is to demonstrate why, especially with large data sets, it's so
important to make wise decisions with regards to what data structures you use.
